### WTF is Kabri?

**Kabri is the Mauritian Creole word for Goat.** Goats are intelligent, inquisitive, often found roaming in places they shouldn&#8217;t and aren&#8217;t afraid to climb up sheer cliff faces to get to the good stuff. Basically, the key traits of any IT professional ðŸ˜‰

### Alright, and you are?

Hello! My name&#8217;s Phil. I&#8217;m an IT Professional working in Cambridge, England.

I&#8217;ve been using PCs from a very young age. Mostly breaking them to begin with, and then gradually learning and understandingÂ how to fix what I&#8217;d broken. And here I am today ðŸ™‚

My perspectives and experiencesÂ come from having worked inÂ companies of differing sizes and dynamics:Â fromÂ [small familyÂ runÂ companies](http://www.crownhillassociates.com/)Â and [rapidly growing Start-ups,](http://www.displaylink.com) toÂ [Fortune 500 organisations](http://www.broadcom.com/).

I have a keenÂ interest in Virtualisation and Storage, complemented by a broad interest in the way IT interacts and communicatesÂ with the rest of the business. My main/current areas of expertise are rarely focused purely on technology, and mostlyÂ involve enabling EngineersÂ to create better products, faster; and helping teams to collaborate more effectively.

You can find out more about me on LinkedIn:

### This site

This site is an attempt to re-balance the universe. After years of milking the internet for IT knowledge, I thought it was about time I gave something back to the community.

I mainly use this blog to jot down anything I come across in my work/play that I think may be useful to other people. If any of it helps you out, feel free to comment.Â A quick hello is always welcome ðŸ™‚

### Work

I spend my working hours at a fabless-semiconductor company in Cambridge.

### Books

[<img title="My bookshelf includes a lot of titles" src="/images/bookshelf.jpg" alt="My bookshelf includes a lot of titles" border="0" />](/images/bookshelf-large.jpg)

Ah, books. Whenever I&#8217;m interested in a subject, I often check out some online resources and then dive onto Amazon and buy a few recommended books on the subject. DisplayLink&#8217;s been great as well &#8211; frequently purchasing books that will help me work more effectively or progress my career.
