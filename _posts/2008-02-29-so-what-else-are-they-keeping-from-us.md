Yesterday it was announced that Prince Harry had been &#8220;secretly deployed&#8221; in Afghanistan for the past [10 weeks](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/7269743.stm); his deployment and whereabouts kept secret [through a pact](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/02/news_blackout.html) between the Ministry Of Defence and the media. 

Putting aside the very valid issues surrounding the safety of himself, and his comrades, it really does make me wonder what else is being kept from us via secret &#8220;agreements&#8221;.
