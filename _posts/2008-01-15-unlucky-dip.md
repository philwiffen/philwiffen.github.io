Here&#8217;s something that I often wonder about when buying a lottery ticket: Is the National Lottery&#8217;s Lucky Dip algorithm truly pseudo-random, or is it rigged to pick from a pool of statistically/historically less-likely numbers? Further more, who regulates the algorithm, and is it independently tested?

The same goes for those online Flash &#8216;scratchcard&#8217; games.
