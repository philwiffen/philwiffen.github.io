As someone who looks after a Blackberry Enterprise Server, I&#8217;ve been hearing an awful lot of &#8216;buzz&#8217; from RIM about the 5.0 release &#8211; but nothing that really spoke out to me as an Admin. Fortunately for me, CIO.com has [nicely summarised](http://www.cio.com/article/print/480588) what&#8217;s new in BES 5.0.

One of the stand-out things for me is the easing of OS upgrades. Hopefully the days of checking out the crackberry.com forums for the latest software will be long gone. The ability to actually schedule remote OS upgrades at a time convenient for the end-user is also very, very welcome.

I&#8217;m looking forward to 5.0 ðŸ™‚
