In GnuPG, if you get an error saying &#8220;There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user&#8221; when trying to encrypt, you need to sign the public key.

You can sign the key by typing &#8220;`gpg --sign-key <em>user-id</em>`&#8221; at the command prompt.

Footnote: I came across this whilst migrating our e-commerce system to a new server. The system uses GnuPG to encrypt the order/credit card information and then emails it to our sales team. I&#8217;m making sure I document the process fully, so that I don&#8217;t have to spend so much time figuring this stuff out again! ðŸ™‚
