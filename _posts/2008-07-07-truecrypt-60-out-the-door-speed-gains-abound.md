My colleague Dave just pointed out that [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) 6.0 was released on Friday, 4th July. The most important new feature here is that encrypt/decrypt speeds are massively improved on multi-core processors &#8211; multiplied by the amount of cores you have (e.g. 2x for dual core).

I&#8217;ll be testing this out on one of the Execs later ðŸ˜‰
