On reading about the new [Asus N10J](http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=5&l2=75&l3=792&l4=0&model=2515&modelmenu=1), it seems that it allows you to log in using your face:

> ##### Smart Technology – Quick Logons through Facial Recognition
> 
> Continuing with the tradition of breaking tradition, ASUS introduces a whole new way in which users logon to their computers—through facial recognition. The SmartLogon system detects the user&#8217;s face and logs on without any intervention from the user. This system is designed to learn the variations of the user&#8217;s facial features, and is capable of performing detection in different lighting conditions.

Maybe I&#8217;m a cynic, but I wonder what happens if you take a photo of the target user, print it out life-size and show it to the camera? It might even work with a high-res passport photo scan. Hmmmm, curious&#8230;
