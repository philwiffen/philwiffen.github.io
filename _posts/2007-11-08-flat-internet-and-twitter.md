### Flat

Moved into the flat last Friday, and am still moving bits in slowly ðŸ™‚

### Internet

Should have internet installed tomorrow morning, provided Virgin Media do as they promise first time around (rare, in my experience). 

Not that I care much, since I&#8217;ve been sharing a space with friends, the social interaction / Mario Karting more than supplements any online social activities I used to engage in whilst alone at home!

### Twitter

Also just installed Twitter + Plugin as a lot of the stuff in my head isn&#8217;t worthy of a blog post.

Stay tuned, I have a fairly useful Tech post coming up tomorrow! ðŸ™‚
