ComputerWorldUK has an article discussing the findings of a recent survey by King Research, where it was discovered that [90% of IT Professionals Don&#8217;t Want Vista](http://www.computerworlduk.com/management/infrastructure/applications/news/index.cfm?newsid=6258). 

Going from my own experience with Vista &#8211; poor stability and woeful performance &#8211; I&#8217;m not surprised about this at all. Maybe &#8211; as with XP &#8211; SP1 will fix these issues, but until then, I remain unimpressed and unconvinced.
