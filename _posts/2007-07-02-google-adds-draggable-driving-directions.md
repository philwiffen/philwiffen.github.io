This morning, whilst organising my journey to an interview, I noticed that Google Maps now lets you drag and rearrange the route it specifies when giving driving directions. In the past you had to take the route it decided was best for you, even if your knowledge of local traffic patterns meant you&#8217;d never take that particular road. Well now, you can carve out your own route &#8211; very cool!
