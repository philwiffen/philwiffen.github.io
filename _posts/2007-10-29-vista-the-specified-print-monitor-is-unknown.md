![The specified print monitor is unknown](http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/the-specified-print-monitor-is-unknown.png)

### Symptoms

When trying to install a shared network printer in Windows Vista, you get an error which states:

> Windows cannot connect to the printer.  
> The specified print monitor is unknown.

### The Cause

This is a bug in Vista. If you disable the UAC, Vista is seemingly unable to add a network printer.

### The Fix

To fix this, you&#8217;ll need to install a &#8220;Performance and Reliability Update&#8221;, [KB938979](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938979). Bizarrely, this update is listed as Optional by Windows Update, and so you may not have installed it. I shall refrain from commenting further on the lunacy of this ðŸ˜‰
