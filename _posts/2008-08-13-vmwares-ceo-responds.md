Paul Maritz, VMware&#8217;s CEO, [has posted an explanation](http://blogs.vmware.com/console/2008/08/letter-from-vmw.html) of the time-bomb &#8220;incident&#8221; that occurred yesterday.

It&#8217;s a sincere post, explaining what happened, why, and how VMware intend to improve their QA processes and regain customer confidence.

As someone who&#8217;s VMware fan-boyism has been tarnished by this incident, I&#8217;ll be interested to see how they&#8217;re going to go about rebuilding customer confidence &#8220;fully and quickly&#8221;&#8230;
