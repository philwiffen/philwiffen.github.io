I&#8217;m about to see if/how I can integrate our Sage accounting and stock system into our existing e-commerce database. The idea is to reduce the duplication of information as, at present, all orders are re-typed into Sage even though a fair bit of the data already exists in the database. How very inefficient!

Wish me luck ðŸ˜€

Update: Well that was a false start. I was told Sage had a 45-day trial. It doesn&#8217;t, so I&#8217;ll have to wait for a licence code. D&#8217;oh!

Update (2007-05-01):Ã‚Â  Seems Sage Instant Accounts Plus can&#8217;t use MySQL, so I&#8217;ll have to look into e-mailing the order details in CSV format as an attachment. One for the back-burner! ðŸ™‚
