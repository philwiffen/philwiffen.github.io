The more I play video content from a USB stick on the Xbox 360, the more I want a TV that can play content directly from a USB Mass Storage Device.

Surely it can&#8217;t be that hard? I&#8217;m thinking possibly something like a tiny Linux distribution embedded into the TV, something akin to the &#8220;Instant Play&#8221; feature on many laptops.
