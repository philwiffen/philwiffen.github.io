Just realised that the WordPress update I did the other day completely screwed the Sidebar on the site, rendering it useless/unreadable. For some reason, WordPress deleted my old sidebar widget settings and put me back to some default. Hopefully I&#8217;ve restored it to roughly how it looked before, but I&#8217;ll never know (Grr&#8230;).
