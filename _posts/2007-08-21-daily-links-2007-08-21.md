Today&#8217;s post marks the start of what I hope to be a regular feature: A summary of the links I found most interesting today. There&#8217;ll be a heavy tech focus, but I&#8217;ll also be wandering into Science and other diversions as this progresses!

Anyway, on to the day&#8217;s links&#8230;

### Technology

**[Firefox address bar tweak (Stops &#8216;Highlight URL&#8217;)](http://paininthetech.com/2007/08/16/firefox-address-bar-tweak/)**  
When clicking on the address bar in Firefox, by default, it highlights the entire URL. As a web-developer, nothing is more annoying than having to click multiple times on the address bar to modify a URL. This tweak solves that problem, allowing you to get cursor focus where you need it, first time.

**[3 launches tenner-a-month data](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/08/20/three_cheapo_data_plans/)**  
About time&#8230; the cost of mobile data in the UK has been astronomical until now!

**[Monster.com attack steals user data](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6956349.stm)**  
Major security breach at Monster.com &#8211; around 1.6million records stolen.

**[Wikipedia Spin Tracker](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/vote-on-the-top.html)**  
Very clever use of publicly available data to work out who&#8217;s spinning what, from where.

### Business

**[Tech-savvy young lack basic literacy skills](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,39288654,00.htm)**  
This article highlights some things that I believe anyone wishing to stand out from the crowd needs: An understanding of business operations (and how IT facilitates business), and a grasp of basic language skills (particularly writing, spelling and grammar). No one in business is going to take you seriously if you &#8216;tlk lyk dis&#8217;.
