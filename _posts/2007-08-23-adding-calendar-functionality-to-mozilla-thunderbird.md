In a business environment, people who switch from Microsoft Outlook to [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/) often miss having the calendar/task features in Outlook. Fortunately, you can add Calendar and Task functionality to Thunderbird with the [Lightning add-on](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/).

  * Go to the [Lightning download page](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/download.html)
  * Right click on the download link and Save As&#8230; (If you don&#8217;t, Firefox might try to install the add-on itself.)
  * Open up Thunderbird and click on Tools > Add-ons
  * Install the Lightning file you just downloaded
  * Once you&#8217;re done, restart Thunderbird, and start using your new Calendar feature!
  * If you need Holiday calendars, you can get them [here](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/holidays.html)
