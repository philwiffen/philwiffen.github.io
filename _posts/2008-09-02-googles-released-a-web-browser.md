It&#8217;s called Google Chrome (A play on Firefox&#8217;s name for the visual interface, I&#8217;m guessing).

[Check out Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome). It&#8217;s a Windows only download at the moment.

There&#8217;s a Chrome [Comic book](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/) too, which explains more about what&#8217;s in the browser and why it looks like it&#8217;s going to solve all my browser gripes ðŸ˜‰

Let me know what you think of it!
