This is too funny not to post.

I&#8217;ve spent all morning trying to log on to Microsoft&#8217;s eAgreement website in order to sign our new OVS agreement, but have been getting error messages all over the place. I made sure I was using IE and not Chrome or Firefox, as they often cause issues.

After emailing their support team, it turns out that their website it not compatible with Internet Explorer 8.

So much for dog-fooding ðŸ˜‰
