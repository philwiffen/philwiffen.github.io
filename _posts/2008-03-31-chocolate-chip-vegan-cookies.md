After cutting out a good 99% of dairy from my diet, I managed to make myself [lactose intolerant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance).

These delicious cookies are not just free from dairy, they&#8217;re free from all animal ingredients ðŸ™‚

### You&#8217;ll need&#8230;

  * 225 grams of dairy-free margarine at room temperature (1 cup) 
      * [Pure](http://www.puredairyfree.co.uk/), [Suma](http://www.suma.co.uk/BrandSpreads_css.html) and [Vitalite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalite) are all Dairy-free margarines.
  * 280 grams sugar (1.25 cups) 
      * Fair-Trade if you can ðŸ™‚
  * 1 tablespoon molasses 
      * Molasses is sometimes hard to find in supermarkets. Try somewhere like Holland and Barrett or your local health food store.
  * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  * 280 grams all-purpose flour (2.5 cups)
  * 1 teaspoon baking powder
  * A pinch of teaspoon salt (I don&#8217;t use any at all)
  * 100 grams of Dark chocolate chips (1.5 cups) 
      * [SuperCook Plain chocolate chips](http://www.supercook.co.uk/products/chocolate-chips/supercook-plain-chocolate-chips/11199) are good &#8211; and Dairy free.

I have tried to quote products available in the UK, but you can find most of these ingredients in your local supermarket or health food store.

### Let&#8217;s go&#8230;

  1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius (350 F)
  2. Cream together margarine and sugar until fluffy.
  3. Add molasses and vanilla
  4. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mix well.
  5. Fold in the chocolate chips
  6. Put on an ungreased baking tray, in teaspoon fulls, 5cm apart. (2 inches)
  7. Bake for 8-10 mins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until slightly browned. Don&#8217;t leave them longer &#8211; they might not look ready after 10 minutes, but they are, trust me!
  8. Leave to stand for a minute and slide them off onto a cooling rack before running your next batch.
  9. Have a sneaky one while you&#8217;re waiting for the rest to cook, then share and enjoy! ðŸ˜€
