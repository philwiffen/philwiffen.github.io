If, like me, you&#8217;re eagerly anticipating Win 7, you could do a lot worse than check out [what&#8217;s new in Win 7 for IT Pros](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/dd350196.aspx).

If you prefer video/speech to reading, there&#8217;s a [very good video](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/dd459187.aspx?ITPID=secnews) available for download as well ðŸ™‚
