It&#8217;s a title that may need a little explanation.

Lately, work and life have been a bit crazy and I&#8217;ve had very little time to blog anything of merit. I began to experiment with twitter to post short updates on things. then as time got more constrained, my twittering increased and blogging floundered.  At this point, I figured it&#8217;d be a good idea to integrate my twitterings directly into the blog feed to prevent things going stale.

**I was wrong.** 

Last week, I started to get the feeling that the integration wasn&#8217;t working. The blog didn&#8217;t feel right; something more akin to a life status feed rather than a blog :/

Then [Danny](http://dannyman.toldme.com/) sent me some [constructive feedback](http://www.kabri.uk/2008/10/12/twitter-updates-for-2008-10-12/#comment-8879) this morning. He&#8217;s right: the tweets just create too much noise; and quickly, any value that the blog had evaporates.

So, the integrated **&#8220;in-feed&#8221; twitter updates are gone**. They&#8217;re still in my sidebar, but you&#8217;ll no longer see them as part of the RSS feed or in the normal blog bits.

I&#8217;m hoping now that the ratio of Signal vs Noise can be restored.

Cheers,
