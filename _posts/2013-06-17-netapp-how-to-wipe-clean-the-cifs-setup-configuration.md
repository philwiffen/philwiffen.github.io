Sometimes you need to completely wipe the &#8220;cifs setup&#8221; configuration. For example, I&#8217;m currentlyÂ writingÂ some documentation and need a clean cifs setup to start from scratch.

# Steps

> `cylon> cifs terminate<br />
cylon> priv set advanced<br />
cylon*> mv /etc/cifsconfig_setup.cfg /etc/cifsconfig_setup.cfg.bak<br />
cylon*> priv set<br />
cylon> cifs restart<br />
CIFS not configured. Use "cifs setup" to configure<br />
cylon> cifs setup`

I found the steps via a search on NetApp&#8217;s forums. Here&#8217;s theÂ thread for more background: [How to Remove CIFS from a Filer?](https://communities.netapp.com/thread/23670)

User [aborzenkov](https://communities.netapp.com/people/aborzenkov)&#8216;s postÂ has the answer I was looking forÂ ðŸ™‚
