  <h2>
    Nomad Jukebox &#8211; Installing Original Windows 98 Support
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The Creative&#8217;s Nomad Jukebox Zen NX and Xtra supposedly only support 98SE/ME/2000/XP, but it&#8217;s still possible to transfer files to your Nomad with Windows 98 First Edition.

  <h2>
    The Solution
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    The solution is shockingly simple. If you try to install Creative Media Source, it&#8217;ll tell you your version of Windows is too old. But it&#8217;s OK, all is not lost &#8211; we don&#8217;t need Creative Media Source. All you need is:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      The latest <a title="Get Nomad Drivers" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041013140342/http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/drivers/">Creative Nomad Zen Drivers</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041013140342/http://www.nomadness.net/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownloaddetails&lid=219&ttitle=Nomad_Explorer">Creative Nomad Explorer</a>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Install these, reboot. And you can begin dragging and dropping files to the Nomad Explorer Icon (Or window) which shows on My Computer. A lot of features from Media Source are obviously missing, but to be honest, all most people care about is moving their files onto the Player, and this is a good temporary solution
