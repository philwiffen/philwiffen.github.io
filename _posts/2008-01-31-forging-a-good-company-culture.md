A friend of a friend just started work at [Red Gate](http://www.red-gate.com/) in Cambridge. I&#8217;ve heard about them before, when they won a _Best Small Companies to Work For_ award last year; and from looking at their website, it&#8217;s clear to see why.

Here&#8217;s some things that stand out for me (and that a lot of companies can learn from):

  * Their site is insanely easy to navigate &#8211; and crucially, it&#8217;s easy to identify where you are in the site infrastructure.
  * The fact that Red Gate&#8217;s [career pages](http://www.red-gate.com/careers/index.htm) give a completely transparent view inside the company.
  * Red Gate has ethics, and [gives back to the community](http://www.red-gate.com/careers/community_and_environment.htm) &#8211; and helps employees to do so
  * The principles behind the [Feel Good Fund](http://www.red-gate.com/careers/feel_good.htm), not to mention things like Massages, yoga, and the feel good fridge!
  * Red Gate has quiet areas. Open Plan offices are fantastic, but sometimes you just need to lock down and concentrate without any chance of interruption.

What do you think makes a good company?
