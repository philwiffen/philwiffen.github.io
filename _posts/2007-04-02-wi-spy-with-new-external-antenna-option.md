The guys over at Metageek are [gearing up to release a new version](http://metageek.net/blog/2007/03/19/FCC-Goodness/) of the well-received Wi-Spy 2.4GHz spectrum analyser, which will include an SMA connector for connecting external antennas.

If you work or play with Wi-Fi networks and you&#8217;ve never heard of Wi-Spy, it&#8217;s worth checking out. Small, and affordable, Wi-Spy is a very capable wireless spectrum analyser. You just plug in the USB dongle, load up the Chanalyzer software and you&#8217;ll be seeing the 2.4GHz spectrum in no time. It&#8217;s fantastic for wireless troubleshooting (especially when your wireless network seems slow or keeps dropping out) &#8211; enabling you to confidently choose a Wi-Fi channel with less interference, as opposed to the old method of &#8216;blindy&#8217; changing channels and hoping things improve.

You can find out more at my [Wireless Analysis](http://www.wireless-analysis.co.uk/) site.

If you already have Wi-Spy, what do you use it for?
