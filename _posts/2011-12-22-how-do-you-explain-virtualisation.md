I was just reading “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/billion-dollar-server-guy-leaves-cisco-2011-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco’s Billion-Dollar Server Guy Has Left</a>“, over at Business Insider, and it explains Virtualisation as:

&nbsp;

> “virtualization software tricks applications into thinking they are on their own servers, even though they are sharing one with many others”

&nbsp;

Which is an interesting take; although I think the use of “tricks” makes it sound a lot more hacky/dodgy than it really is.

&nbsp;

As a Virtualisation enthusiast, explaining Virtualisation to a non-technical audience has always been an interesting conundrum for me.

&nbsp;

How do you explain Virtualisation “in a nutshell” to non-techies?
