Like most IT Professionals, I use a whole array of keyboard shortcuts to speed up my working throughout the day. In this two-part series, I&#8217;ll share some of the more useful ones with you.

In this post &#8211; Part 1 &#8211; I&#8217;ll cover shortcuts I use when generally working with, and troubleshooting, Windows. In Part 2, I&#8217;ll cover shortcuts for Working with Files and Text.

### Part 1 &#8211; Working with Windows

**Control + Shift + Escape**  
Instantly brings up Task Manager. Always handy for troubleshooting, and especially useful in a Domain environment, where the traditional Ctrl+Alt+Del brings up a Windows Security panel.

**WinKey + D**  
Shows the Desktop, minimising all windows. Press it again, and all your windows are restored. This shortcut is superior to WinKey+M, as it retains all window positions.

**WinKey + L**  
Locks your workstation. Incredibly useful if you work in IT, and frequently need to leave your PC at a moment&#8217;s notice.

**Alt + Tab**  
Switches between open windows. To scroll &#8220;backwards&#8221; use Alt + Shift + Tab. Sometimes quicker than using the taskbar, sometimes not ðŸ˜‰

**WinKey + Break** (sometimes labeled Pause)  
Opens up Systems Properties quickly.

**WinKey + R**  
Opens up the Run command, ready for your bidding ðŸ˜‰

**Alt + F4**  
Close the current window. Also, Ctrl + F4 closes the current tab in Firefox and IE7, and many other applications which feature Tabbed navigation.

**Control + Tab**  
Switches tabs in Mozilla Firefox / Internet Explorer 7 (and a lot of other programmes that use Tabs). To go backwards, use Control + Shift + Tab.

Note: WinKey is short for Windows Key. It&#8217;s the key with the Windows symbol on it, usually between the Ctrl button and the Space Bar ðŸ™‚
