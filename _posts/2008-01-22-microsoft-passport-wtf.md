Until about 10 minutes ago I used my colleague&#8217;s Windows Live ID passport to get our Volume Licence stuff. To make things easier, I just signed up for my own Live ID using my displaylink.com address, and then filled out a profile, including things like my name, address, company, job title. 

I then successfully log on to eOpen, and add the relevant licences. Then of course I want to download one of the applications, so I click on Product Downloads, and what do I see? 

This:

WTF. I just filled out this information 2 minutes ago. **Why can&#8217;t Microsoft pre-fill this information based on the information I just gave it!** I thought the whole point of &#8216;Live ID&#8217; passporty-thing was to make single-sign-on a reality and enable the sharing of information from a central repository. 

What a load of crap. I really despair sometimes&#8230;
