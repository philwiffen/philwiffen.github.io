Yesterday, we released a beta version of the [Mac driver for DisplayLink-enabled products](http://www.displaylink.com/mac). The guys working on this have done a fantastic job in a very, very short time and should be commended for their efforts. Sadly, due to the closed nature of OS X we&#8217;ve been unable to get the performance as we&#8217;d like it.

As the [Beta page](http://http//www.displaylink.com/mac_beta_drivers.html) says:

> DisplayLink is committed to making a Mac release that is just as good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if not better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ than our Windows Vista release, including full support for OpenGL 3D acceleration. Unfortunately the Mac OS X operating system is a closed system, and unlike Windows XP and Windows Vista, it is difficult to make significant improvements without the direct support of Apple. If you would like to see improved support for DisplayLink USB devices from Apple, please let them know through the <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Feedback form for Mac OS X</a>.

Hopefully Apple will be able to help us out with some of the issues we&#8217;ve been having ðŸ™‚
