Sometimes, I just want to _quickly_ resize some images before sharing them over IM or via e-mail&#8230;

I&#8217;ve found that Microsoft&#8217;s Image Resizer is fantastic for quick photo resizing. Of course, I could do it in Fireworks and retain the quality but to do more than 3 images it becomes a waste of my time. And I&#8217;m all about utilising my time effectively ðŸ™‚
