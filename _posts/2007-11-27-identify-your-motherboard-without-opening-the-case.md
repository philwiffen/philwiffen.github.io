It&#8217;s a problem we all encounter at some point: You&#8217;ve just re-installed Windows, and now you need to download your Mainboard drivers. But which motherboard do you have again?

Instead of opening your PC case to find the Motherboard model number, check out [**CPU-Z**](http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php) ðŸ™‚

[CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php) is a free, stand-alone application (no installer) that very quickly lets you know your system&#8217;s vital statistics (CPU, Mobo, and RAM), so that you can head off and find the drivers you need, without having to open up the PC.

This is something I come across frequently when I&#8217;m performing OS refreshes at [DisplayLink](http://www.displaylink.com/). I imagine it&#8217;s a common problem in most start-ups (are we still are start-up? haha), where PCs are bought to spec on an ad-hoc basis. Often, the only way of finding out the motherboard number is by opening the case, lifting cables, and poking around the motherboard, in an attempt to find the tiny bit of writing on the PCB that tells you its model number. Hardly ideal!
