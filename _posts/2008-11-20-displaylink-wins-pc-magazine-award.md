[PC Magazine](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2332991,00.asp) just awarded DisplayLink a Technical Excellence Award for our DL-160 chip ðŸ™‚

> **DisplayLink DL-160**
> 
> There are several technologies available today that can send a video signal through a computer&#8217;s USB port to a monitor or projector, but DisplayLink is by far the most impressive. The combination of software (to redirect video through the USB port), and hardware (in the form of a chip in the display device or external video adapter) lets you connect, and expand your desktop to cover, up to six monitors by way of a single USB port on your PC. With the DL-160 chip, DisplayLink adds support for monitors with up to 1,600-by-1,200 resolution, and it works with Windows XP, Vista, Vista 64-bit, and Vista Aero. There&#8217;s even a beta version of the software for Mac OS X.
