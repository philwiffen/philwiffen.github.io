If, like us, you run a <acronym title="Business Desktop Deployment">BDD</acronym> or <acronym title="Microsoft Deployment Toolkit">MDT</acronym> setup in order to install your Operating Systems, this might be useful ðŸ™‚

If you&#8217;d like to pre-install Vista updates and hotfixes while Vista is installing:

  1. Go to your Distribution Share (C:\Distribution)
  2. Go into Operating Systems, then find your Vista OS (C:\Distribution\Operating Systems\Windows Vista Business SP1 &#8211; 32bit\)
  3. Create a new folder in this directory called &#8220;update&#8221;
  4. Copy all of your Vista Update files (.msu) into this directory
  5. That&#8217;s it ðŸ™‚ The next time you run a Vista deployment, the updates will be pre-installed!

  The same concept applies to installing from a Vista DVD.
