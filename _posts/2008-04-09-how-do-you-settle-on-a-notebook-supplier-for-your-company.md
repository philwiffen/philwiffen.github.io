I&#8217;m curious about this. How does a company come to settle on a specific brand or specification of laptop &#8211; or any PC for that matter?

Lately, I&#8217;ve gone for Dells, as they make it nice and easy. I can call or email my account manager, give him a base unit reference from their website, ask for a number of changes (&#8220;I want a spare power adapter, an _x_ res screen and a _y_ size HD instead&#8221;) and they do it all for me, _and_, more often than not, get me a quote within an hour.

So far, I&#8217;ve found it hard to find that flexibility and convenience. Unless I&#8217;m missing something/someone&#8230;

#### So the question is&#8230;

Everyone: What brand machines does your current company use?

IT Pros: Which brand(s) do you buy for your company PCs, and more importantly, why?
