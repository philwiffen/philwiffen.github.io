One of my biggest issues with [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) is that it&#8217;s only possible to give recommendations to people you&#8217;ve worked with in a &#8216;job&#8217; capacity. It&#8217;s not possible to recommend a tutor, or a fellow student whom you&#8217;ve worked with during your Education. As someone who&#8217;s only recently started their career, I haven&#8217;t worked with many people in my Job capacity, making it hard to request and give Recommendations based on my job alone. With this in mind, I recently asked if LinkedIn will implement Education recommendations.

Here&#8217;s their response:

> We do not do recommendations for education only for positions. I  
> think it would be a great idea to have this feature added. I will pass  
> along the suggestion.
