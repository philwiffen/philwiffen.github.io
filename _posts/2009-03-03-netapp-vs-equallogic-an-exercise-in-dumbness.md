So right now, we&#8217;re looking for an iSCSI capable SAN solution. Plenty of vendors, all with advantages and disadvantages. So I jump on the interwebs to do a bit of background research.

And pretty much all I can find is NetApp employees/fanboys and EqualLogic employees/fanboys picking apart each other&#8217;s tiny failings and sniping at each other using negative language, in a manner that I can only describe as pathetic.

Seriously guys, stop it. I just want to know what&#8217;s best for me, not what&#8217;s best for you&#8230;
