Just got word from our Dell Account Manager that the Dell Latitude E4200 and E4300 are now available for quotation and ordering in the UK. They&#8217;re also available on the [Dell website](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/category.aspx/latit?c=uk&cs=ukbsdt1&l=en&s=bsd&~ck=mn).

My initial thoughts on seeing the specs: It&#8217;s disappointing that the E4200 has no &#8220;normal&#8221; HDD option, unlike its older 12.1&#8243; sibling, the D430. It is however, incredibly light &#8211; only 1kg with a 4-cell battery.
