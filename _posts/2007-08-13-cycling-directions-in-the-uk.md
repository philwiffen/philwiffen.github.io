What with my [new job](http://www.displaylink.com/), I&#8217;m currently looking for a place to rent in Cambridge. As I fully intend to cycle to work, it&#8217;s quite important that I know how long it&#8217;ll take me to cycle from where I live to where I&#8217;ll be working in the city. 

After much searching and sighing I discovered that **[ViaMichelin](http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/int/dyn/controller/Driving_directions) allows you to choose &#8220;By bike&#8221; routes, as well as &#8220;On foot&#8221; routes**. Very cool, and certainly much more forward-thinking than the AA and RAC journey planners.

Maybe Google, [with their Green stance](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/14/who-cares-the-most-about-the-environment/), should add this feature to [Google Maps](http://maps.google.co.uk/) too? ðŸ™‚
