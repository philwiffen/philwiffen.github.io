If you&#8217;ve ever misplaced, or forgotten to document, one of your passwords stored in an application, [Asterisk Key](http://www.lostpassword.com/asterisk.htm) is a free and invaluable tool.

Asterisk Key reveals saved passwords from most Windows apps and even Internet Explorer (which is probably a good reason to switch to Firefox!)

It doesn&#8217;t work on everything, but it&#8217;s worth a shot!
