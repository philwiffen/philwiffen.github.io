I somehow missed this until last week, but EMC have provided a nice index of all their free e-training courses on Backup, Storage and Infrastructure management. All you need is a free EMC account to get access.

Subjects include EMC Isilon (Scale out NAS), EMC Networker (Backup and recovery) and ViPR, amongst others! Well worth checking out:
