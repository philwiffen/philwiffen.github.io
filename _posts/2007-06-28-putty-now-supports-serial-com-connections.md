This is pretty cool: Whilst searching for an alternative to HyperTerminal that supports Serial Port connections, I discovered that PuTTY now connects to Serial COM ports as well as the usual SSH/Telnet stuff ðŸ˜€

As a business you can&#8217;t use [HyperTerminal Private Edition](http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/index.html) unless you pay a licence fee; and now that Microsoft has removed HyperTerminal from Windows Vista, finding an Open Source, free-for-commercial-use, replacement for HyperTerminal is invaluable for budget constrained IT departments.

[Download PuTTY here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

It also seems that [Poderosa](http://www.poderosa.org/) support Serial comms with a [plugin](http://en.poderosa.org/download/plugins.html), which I wasn&#8217;t aware of until reading this [blog post](http://blogs.lanlogic.net/blogs/tom/archive/2006/12/21/HyperTerminal-for-Vista.aspx).

What do you use instead of HyperTerminal? I&#8217;d love to hear about any programs I&#8217;ve missed! ðŸ™‚
