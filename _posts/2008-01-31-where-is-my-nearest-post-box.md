OK, so I&#8217;m lazy; I want to drop off a load of letters with a minimal amount of effort.

Now, for some bizarre reason, Royal Mail don&#8217;t have a Post Box finder on their site. All I can find is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/content1?catId=400044&mediaId=2600036">this page</a>, which states:

> Nothing could be simpler than dropping your mail into one of our Postboxes. There are 115,000 Postboxes nationwide, so wherever you find yourself, there&#8217;s one not too far away.

Cute. But why can&#8217;t you tell me how &#8220;not too far away&#8221; one is! You can [tell me where my nearest Post Office is](http://www.royalmail.com/portal/po/finder), so is it really that much more of a stretch to give me the closest postbox?

I wonder if there&#8217;s a social-networking-type website that maps out Post Boxes? I&#8217;m envisioning a Google Maps mash up type thing! Hmmm&#8230;

Update: Matt Bryce has created PostBoxr to help you [find your nearest postbox](http://www.postboxr.co.uk/). See his comment below for more details. I&#8217;ve added two post boxes in Cambridge already ðŸ˜‰
