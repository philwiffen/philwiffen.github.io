![OpenOffice](http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/logo-oo.gif)

To get [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) to Save in Microsoft Word .doc format by default, follow these steps:

  * Tools > Options
  * Load/Save > General
  * In the bottom right of the window, look for &#8220;Always save as&#8221; and pick your poison ðŸ˜‰

I know that saving in a proprietary format over an open standard is bad practice, but sometimes in Business you need to maintain interoperability with the de facto standard; in this case: Microsoft Word.
