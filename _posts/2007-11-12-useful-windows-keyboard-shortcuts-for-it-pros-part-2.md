Following on from Part 1, where I shared some [useful keyboard shortcuts for general Windows usage](http://www.kabri.uk/2007/11/09/useful-windows-keyboard-shortcuts-for-it-pros-part-1/), Part 2 covers useful shortcuts for working with Files and Text.

### Working with Files and Text

**F2**  
Rename the highlighted file in Explorer. Edits a Cell in Excel / OpenOffice Calc.

**Alt + Enter**  
View properties of the selected item. Works in Explorer, but also works in other places, including Outlook.

**Shift + Drag file**  
Moves files instead of copying them to separate volumes or disks.

**Control + A**  
Selects all text, or all files in a directory. Very useful when you need to highlight everything and then Copy or Move (Cut) it somewhere.

**Control + C**  
Copies the highlighted item (could be text, or a file/folder). Also, **Control + X** cuts the highlighted item.

**Control + V**  
Pastes whatever you just copied.

**Control + Z**  
Undoes your last action. This even applies when you&#8217;ve deleted a file and want to restore it. Always useful when writing up blog posts ðŸ˜‰

**Control + Y**  
Reapplies the action you just &#8220;undid&#8221;.

### Text Specific

**Control + B**  
Emboldens selected text, or starts to embolden text after you&#8217;ve used the shortcut. Use it again to turn off emboldening.

**Control + I**  
Italicises selected text, or starts to italicise text after you&#8217;ve used the shortcut. Use it again to turn off italicise.

**Control + U**  
Underlines selected text, or starts to underline text after you&#8217;ve used the shortcut. Use it again to turn off underline.

**Control + Left or Right Arrow**  
Move forward to back a word.

**Control + Shift + Left or Right Arrow**  
Highlight a word, backwards or forwards. Keep tapping to highlight more words

**Control + Up or Down Arrow**  
Move to beginning or end of a line.

**Shift + Up or Down Arrow**  
Highlight an entire line up or down.

**Control + Backspace**  
Deletes one word to the left (behind).

**Control + Delete**  
Deletes one word to the right (in front).
