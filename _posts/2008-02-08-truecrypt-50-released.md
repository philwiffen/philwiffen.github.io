TrueCrypt 5.0, the open-source, multi-platform encryption suite, is [available for download](http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads.php). New features for Windows include improved write speeds (up to 100% improvement) and **Full Disk Encryption**. They&#8217;ve also released a long-anticipated Mac OSX version ðŸ™‚

Why did I embolden Full Disk Encryption? Because UK companies and Government organisations are losing laptops [left](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7199658.stm), [right](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7209154.stm) and [centre](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7117291.stm) &#8211; without encrypting their sensitive contents. As an IT Professional, you&#8217;d be crazy to not be investigating the various options for keeping your company&#8217;s data safe, in the event of loss or theft.
