If you&#8217;ve downloaded a .chm file, but on opening it, can&#8217;t see anything, I have a solution for you ðŸ™‚

### Ta-da

  * _Right click_ on the file >Â _Properties_
  * Find the &#8220;Unblock&#8221; button, and click it.  
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-261" title="Unblock file" src="http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2008-04-09_141735.png" alt="" width="340" height="112" /> 
  * Re-open the .chm and it should now display properly ðŸ™‚
