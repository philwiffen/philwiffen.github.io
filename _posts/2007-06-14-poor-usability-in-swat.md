As I will be leaving Crownhill at some point, I set up SWAT on our SAMBA server to reduce some of the technical and administrative burden on the company until a replacement is found. Whilst briefly showing the MD how to use it, we discovered a huge usability flaw &#8211; the Delete share button not only looks the same as any other button, but it also provides no &#8220;are you sure?&#8221; confirmation. Clicking the button instantly deletes the share you&#8217;re working on!

As a large part of the world reads from Left to Right, it makes sense that if you&#8217;re in a rush, your natural work flow goes left to right. If I was busy, and wanted to edit the public share, I&#8217;d probably click the button to the right without even thinking &#8211; and with no confirmation dialogue, I&#8217;d have instantly deleted the share that I actually wanted to edit. Not good design at all.
