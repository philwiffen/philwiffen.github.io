Want to set an alarm but don&#8217;t want the standard (annoying) alarm tones on Android?

Try this:

  1. Plug your phone into your computer and mount it as a Disk drive.
  2. Once it&#8217;s mounted, browse to the SD card on your Laptop (On mine it appears as E:)
  3. Browse to E:\Media\audio\
  4. Add a new folder called: alarms
  5. Add your mp3 or wav files into the alarms folder.
  6. Disconnect your phone

You can now choose your custom, personal, alarm sounds when setting an alarm ðŸ˜€
