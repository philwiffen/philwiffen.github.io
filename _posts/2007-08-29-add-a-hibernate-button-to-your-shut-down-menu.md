Over Christmas, I noticed that [Jade](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mindcircus/331274304/in/set-72157594336703742/)&#8216;s Dell laptop had a fourth Hibernate button on the XP Shut Down Menu. Ever since, I&#8217;ve been wanting to add it to my laptop, but somehow never got around to finding out how to do it.

Luckily, YaronM over on [AskTheAdmin](http://www.asktheadmin.com/), has posted an article showing how to go about [adding that Hibernate button to your Shut Down Menu.](http://www.asktheadmin.com/2007/08/how-to-add-hibernate-as-4th-option-in.html)

It sure beats holding shift, and makes it much easier for less IT-savvy people to hibernate&#8230; maybe even saving the planet a little in the process. ðŸ™‚
