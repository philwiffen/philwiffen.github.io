I&#8217;ll get right to the point: Teams work better when they feel safe. And this [one-page PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PsnDMS2emcPLgMLFAQCXZjO7C4j2hJ7znOq_g2Zkjgk/export?format=pdf) from the Re:work team at Google gives clear and actionable things you can do and think about that will help to make your team feel safe. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a manager or a team-member; check them out.

Now, on to the waffle.

**I&#8217;m fascinated by team dynamics** &#8211; what makes them work (or not work), what makes a team excel, and ways in which I can improve, or actions I can take, to get the most out of myself and my colleagues. **People are social animals** &#8211; and I feel **that&#8217;s often forgotten about in a business setting.**

Recently, I stumbled upon [Re:work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/), from Google. The site itself is a veritible trove of information for anyone wanting to improve themselves and their teams, but **one of the most important things** for me when it comes to fostering teamwork **is to ensure that your team feels safe**. that might sound &#8220;cute&#8221;, but **if your team don&#8217;t feel safe**, bad things happen, because thanks to biology, **[they don&#8217;t cooperate as well](http://kabri.uk/2016/01/19/understanding-the-human-animal-the-importance-of-packs-feeling-safe-and-good-leadership/).**

So I was super-chuffed when I found the Re:work site &#8211; and more so when **I discovered this [Actions for Psychological Safety PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PsnDMS2emcPLgMLFAQCXZjO7C4j2hJ7znOq_g2Zkjgk/export?format=pdf) which gives clear and actionable things you can do** (as a leader or as a team member) to help your team feel psychologically safe. I think it&#8217;s well worth checking out. I can already spot a number of things I could do more of.

I&#8217;d love to know what you do to help make your teams feel safe. Let me know in the comments ðŸ™‚
