Be warned: this is a Whinge-piece.

I wanted to provide an update on the [poor customer service](http://kabri.uk/2015/11/27/microsoft-band-an-exercise-in-appalling-customer-service/) I&#8217;ve been receiving from Microsoft UK Support with my original Microsoft Band.

Microsoft seemingly ignored my &#8220;escalated complaint&#8221; through resolver.co.uk that I raised in December 2015, so I raised a new service ticket before the 1 year anniversary of my Band purchase, around March 2016. In May 2016, Microsoft got back to me, and then promptly (again) told me that I wasn&#8217;t eligible for a replacement because they believe I damaged this myself (I definitely didn&#8217;t) and that the damage they witnessed isn&#8217;t covered by the warranty.

I have multiple issues with this whole saga, and Microsoft&#8217;s behaviour in general:

  1. Accusing a customer of purposely damaging an item is pretty poor form.
  2. Microsoft voided my warranty without even contacting me to understand the damage or allow me any kind of response.
  3. Microsoft rejected my request to refund me or replace my Band with a Band 2, which has been designed to avoid the issues I&#8217;ve seen with my original Band.
  4. Microsoft ignored my complaint through [Resolver.co.uk](http://www.resolver.co.uk/)
  5. I hate having to use the law, but Microsoft Support seem to be ignoring The Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended) which states that goods should be as described, of a satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. The Band in my possession, is absolutely not fit for purpose given the wear and tear it&#8217;s sustained since I purchased it.

I&#8217;ve probably said this before but, I love my Band, and have been a fan of Microsoft for a long time. However, this series of incidents has genuinely sullied my opinion of Microsoft. Shame, really.
