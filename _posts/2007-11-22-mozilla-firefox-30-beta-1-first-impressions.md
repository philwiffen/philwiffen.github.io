[Mozilla released Beta 1 of Firefox 3.0](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/) a few days ago, so I thought it was about time I tried out the latest and greatest from the guys at Mozilla. [Grab it here](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html) if you haven&#8217;t yet, but be warned, it&#8217;s only meant for testing, and shouldn&#8217;t be used if you require a stable browser.

I&#8217;ve been running it at work since yesterday afternoon, and upgraded my laptop at home last night. **First impressions are good&#8230;** 

### Resource Usage Improvements

The memory footprint has reduced immensely. Before upgrading, I had over 200 tabs open in Firefox 2.0 using around 1100MB of RAM. After upgrading to 3.0 Beta 1, **the memory footprint has shrunk by half** to just over 600MB. It&#8217;s important to note that these figures are after a day&#8217;s worth of usage, opening/closing tabs throughout the day, on both 2.0 and 3.0 Beta 1. My experience appears to match with Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#8217; over at [ZDNet](http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=960). 

Firefox&#8217;s giant memory footprint was one of my biggest bugbears, and it seems as though 3.0 is making a step in the right direction. This is excellent progress.

CPU usage is down, too. In Firefox 2.0, running 200 tabs used around 45% CPU on a Dual Core. After upgrading to 3.0 Beta 1 CPU usage is running at roughly 15%.

### General Impressions

Overall, the browser seems snappier &#8211; particularly when moving between tabs. I also like the flashy &#8220;whizzy&#8221; thing it does when moving between distant tabs. Very &#8220;[Compiz](http://compiz.org/)&#8220;.

The new, unobtrusive, Remember Password widget is also a welcome addition. It lets you get on, without interrupting your work flow, allowing you to set your preference in your own time.

The Address/Location Bar now searches through your history and bookmarks; not just on URL, but also on page titles. So for example, you can type in &#8220;USB&#8221; into the location bar, and it&#8217;ll show you a list of results. I have mixed feelings about this, as I quite liked just typing in the start of an address, and choosing from a descending list of most frequently viewed sites that match the start of what I&#8217;m typing. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get used to it.

3.0 also adds a Quick Bookmark button next to the Address Bar. This differs to Ctrl + D as it allows you to edit the Bookmark name and add tags. Again, I&#8217;m not entirely sold on it&#8217;s usefulness, but perhaps in time I&#8217;ll find myself using it ðŸ™‚

### Conclusion

Overall, I&#8217;m impressed. The extra little features are nice to have, but the most important improvements, for me, are in 3.0&#8217;s reduced memory and CPU footprint. I certainly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be re-installing Firefox 2.0 anytime soon ðŸ™‚

### Over to you
