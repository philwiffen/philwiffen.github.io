[![DisplayLink Logo](http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/displaylink_logo.gif)](http://www.displaylink.com/)  
I&#8217;m pleased to say that, on the 17th September 2007, I will be joining DisplayLink as a Systems Administrator.

It was a tough decision but, ultimately, DisplayLink offered everything I was looking for in a new role:

  * Great benefits.
  * Relaxed dress code.
  * Flexible working hours.
  * A commitment to support personal and technical development.
  * And finally: I like the company, and I like what they&#8217;re doing.

It&#8217;s got me thinking&#8230; What made you choose your current position? ðŸ™‚
