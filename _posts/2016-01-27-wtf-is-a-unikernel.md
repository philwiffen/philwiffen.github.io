Unikernels are going to shake-up the Docker/Container world, in a really good way. They&#8217;ll make containers more efficient, faster and more secure. What&#8217;s not to love? While I don&#8217;t work with Unikernels, I am very curious about them. Below, I&#8217;ve summarised some resources that may help if you want to learn more about Unikernels. Share and enjoy ðŸ™‚

# From a tech journalist

[Chris Williams](https://twitter.com/diodesign), over at The Register has a [really good write up](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/21/docker_buys_unikernel/) on what Unikernels are, how they work, and what they mean for Containers (including Docker) going forward. Well worth a read if you&#8217;re curious about this kind of thing!
