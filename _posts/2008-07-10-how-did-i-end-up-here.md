Sometimes, I just casually cruise around LinkedIn, seeing who knows who, and where they work &#8211; often clicking off to company and personal websites. Occasionally, I might stumble across something interesting. To show what I mean, here&#8217;s something I found just a few minutes ago:

  1. LinkedIn has [company data on DisplayLink](http://www.linkedin.com/companies/28969/DisplayLink).
  2. We&#8217;re in the same building as NetBanx, so I [check them out](http://www.linkedin.com/companies/105774/NetBanx Ltd).
  3. I see that I&#8217;m somehow linked to a few employees (mainly via our Techincal Recruiter, but also via contacts I made while out job hunting way back when).
  4. I click on someone to see how they&#8217;re linked to me.
  5. This guy has a [personal site](http://www.robbiebow.co.uk/), which I check out.
  6. Ooh, his front page mentions a nice usability tidbit that I wasn&#8217;t aware of, and credits the source
  7. I check [the source](http://joncom.be/)
  8. Discover that the source also makes a verrrry nice looking [AWstats &#8220;wrapper&#8221;](http://www.jawstats.com/) that I&#8217;m just forwarding to my colleague, as some of our marketing guys use AWstats for Web Analytics.

Crazy stuff eh? ðŸ™‚
