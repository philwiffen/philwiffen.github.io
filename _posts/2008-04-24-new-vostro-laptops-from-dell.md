Dell has just launched a few new smaller, lighter [Vostro laptops](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/category.aspx/vostro_nb?c=uk&cs=ukbsdt1&l=en&s=bsd&dgc=EM&cid=22687&lid=530197). If you&#8217;re not familiar with the Vostro range, they&#8217;re aimed at smaller, budget-conscious businesses and provide good value for money &#8211; while sacrificing some of the looks of the more expensive Latitude range. We bought a few Vostros a while ago at work and general feedback has been good, though lately we&#8217;ve been buying Latitudes.

[Check out the new models](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/category.aspx/vostro_nb?c=uk&cs=ukbsdt1&l=en&s=bsd&dgc=EM&cid=22687&lid=530197)
