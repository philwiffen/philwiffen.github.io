This is a tricky one.

I have decided to close the [AirPcap](http://www.kabri.uk/airpcap/) posts to comments.

It&#8217;s been nearly a year since I began blogging about CACE Technologies&#8217; AirPcap adapter, and over 6 months since I last touched an AirPcap adapter. The posts are now pretty stale and I haven&#8217;t kept up with developments in Windows WEP Cracking, making discussion on them rather irrelevant. I also just don&#8217;t have the time nowadays to respond to every email and blog comment that I get from the articles.

Sucks, but that&#8217;s the way it goes sometimes&#8230;
