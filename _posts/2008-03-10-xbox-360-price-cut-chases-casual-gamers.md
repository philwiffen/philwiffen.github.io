[Microsoft have just reduced the price of the Xbox 360](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/03/10/dlxbox110.xml) &#8211; only Â£160 for the basic edition.

What&#8217;s kind of spooky is that, just over the weekend, I was saying that I was considering buying a 360 just to casually play mindless shoot-em-ups on.
