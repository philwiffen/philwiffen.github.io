Following on from my post yesterday about [reacting to critical updates](http://www.kabri.uk/2008/10/24/reacting-to-super-critical-updates/)&#8230;

It seems that no more than a day after Microsoft released a Critical Security update, someone&#8217;s [released a Trojan](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/24/trojan_exploits_wormable_microsoft_flaw/) into the wild that exploits the vulnerability.

Given the &#8220;exploit potential&#8221;, this one sounds relatively tame. I suspect it&#8217;ll only be a matter of time before the exploit code is perfected and turned into a much more potent animal.

Putting a few hours in on Thursday night, has potentially saved us exponentially more hours in data and service recovery, as well as general IT support. It definitely pays to be proactive!
