**How to get Windows Media Center to play MKV files on Windows 7**

**[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-623" title="acer revo" src="http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/acer-revo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/acer-revo.jpg)**

So I just bought an [Acer Revo 3610](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002TI844K?ie=UTF8&tag=mincir0e-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B002TI844K) so that we can watch MKV files without converting them to MP4 and putting them on the Xbox/faffing around with 4GB file limits etc. The Revo is a brilliant box: cheap, tiny, near-silent and plays 1080p video with no dropped frames. I got mine from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dacer%2520revo%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=mincir0e-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=19450)<img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=mincir0e-21&l=ur2&o=2" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, if you&#8217;re curious. They had the best price at the time ðŸ™‚

Anyway, back to Windows Media Center. Out of the box, WMC doesn&#8217;t recognise MKV files. To get this to work:

1. Download and install [Divx 7](http://www.divx.com/en/software/download/start).  
You only need the Codec bits, not the player/converter. This will setup MKV integration into WMC.

2. Download and install [AC3 Filter](http://ac3filter.net/projects/ac3filter/releases)  
This will process AC3 audio if your MKV files has AC3 sound (a lot do, so it&#8217;s worth installing, otherwise you won&#8217;t get any sound)

3. Reboot your PC  
4. Log back in, and open up WMC.  
5. Ta-daa, you can now view (and hear!) MKV files ðŸ˜€
