It is possible to get Kismet to run on Windows without using a drone. How? Well first (and this is probably the killer) you need to have an [AirPcap USB adapter](http://www.crownhill.co.uk/product.php?prod=1779&ref=wireless-analysis) and then you need to download [Kismet for Windows](http://www.cacetech.com/support/downloads.htm).

> What is AirPcap?

> If you need to capture 802.11b/g packets in Windows, then AirPcap is your answer. Made by the guys who brought you WinPcap and [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/), AirPcap enables you to capture raw Wi-Fi packets in Windows. AirPcap fully integrates into Wireshark, giving you a seamless packet capture experience. [Read More AirPcap&#8230;](http://www.wireless-analysis.co.uk/#airpcap)

Kismet for Windows is available from the [CACE Tech website](http://www.cacetech.com/support/downloads.htm). At present, it only works with AirPcap and Kismet drones.
