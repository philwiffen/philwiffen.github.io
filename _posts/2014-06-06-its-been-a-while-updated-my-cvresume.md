So, having been at Broadcom nearly three years, I thought it was about time to update my CV/Resume.

Here it is below, in case you&#8217;re curious:

[Phil Wiffen, Resume 2014, Web Edition](http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/phil-wiffen-cv-2014-07-21-web-edition.pdf "Phil Wiffen, Resume 2014, Web Edition") (Updated 2014-07-21)

It took a lot more effort to update than I anticipated. Turns out pruning old stuff (to keep page counts down) and figuring out how to describe your current role takes quite a bit of time ðŸ™‚

I suspect it&#8217;ll need more work, but I&#8217;m a believer in fast publishing and iteration ðŸ˜‰
