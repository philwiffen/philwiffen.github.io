A whole bunch of my colleagues from DisplayLink are currently in Las Vegas for CES 2008, showing off some of our cool new stuff. If you want to keep up with what we&#8217;re doing, check out our [CES Blog](http://www.displaylink.com/ces08/). Oh, did I mention you can enter to [win a USB Graphics Adapter](http://www.displaylink.com/ces08/enter_to_win.html)? ðŸ˜‰
