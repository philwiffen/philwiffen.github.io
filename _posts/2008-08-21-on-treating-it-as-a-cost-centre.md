From what I know/have seen/have heard, generally, companies see IT departments as cost centres, rather than something that adds business value.

I liked this quote on [joeware.net](http://joeware.net/about/resume-intro.htm):

&#8220;[Computers] will just get more and more important and if you intend to simply coast on whatever talent you get for some poor pay, you deserve everything that happens. I have no problem hearing that tech specialists make more than their managers. IMO, in many cases they should make considerably more. It is the tech specialists who keep your company&#8217;s tech running efficiently.&#8221;

Joeware.net has some [great free IT Pro tools](http://joeware.net/freetools/index.htm) btw ðŸ™‚
