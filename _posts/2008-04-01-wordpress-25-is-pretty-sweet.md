So I upgraded to [WordPress 2.5](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/) the other night. Nothing&#8217;s really changed on the front end, but the new backend is great &#8211; sure it looks nice, but more importantly, it&#8217;s very intuitive and far easier to use. And the icing on the cake was that most of the plugins I use already support 2.5, which is nice.

I think I&#8217;m in lurve ðŸ˜‰
