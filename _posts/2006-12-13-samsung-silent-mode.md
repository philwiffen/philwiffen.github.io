**To activate silent mode on a Samsung phone, press and hold the # key** (hash, pound). To deactivate it, do the same again.

I found this out after telling my Samsung-loving girlfriend that my Samsung phone sucked because it didn&#8217;t have profiles like my beloved old Nokia &#8211; at which point she picked up my mobile, pressed #, and rolled her eyes.

&#8220;Silent Mode activated&#8221; ðŸ™‚

Next time I&#8217;ll RTFM.
