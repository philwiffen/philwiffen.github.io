You&#8217;ve probably run into a drive lettering conflict.

### Possible Symptoms

  * At home, your PC sees your flash drive as drive letter E. (I&#8217;m using E as an example)
  * You go to work and plug in your USB stick, but it doesn&#8217;t show up.

### The likely culprit

This is probably because your PC at work already has a Drive E assigned &#8211; Windows can&#8217;t have two drives with the same drive letter, so your Flash drive can&#8217;t be used. To use it, we need to change the drive letter assigned to the flash stick.

### How to fix it

  1. Right click on My Computer.
  2. Click &#8216;Manage&#8217;.
  3. Click &#8216;Disk Management&#8217; in the Left pane.
  4. Locate your flash stick in the right pane.
  5. Right click on it, and choose &#8216;Change Drive Letter and Paths&#8230;&#8217;.
  6. Click either Change or Add, and assign the drive a new letter. (I usually pick something high up the alphabet, like &#8216;R&#8217;)
  7. Ta-da! Your Flash drive should now appear ðŸ™‚
