One of the things you hear from IT professionals a lot is along the lines of: &#8220;waaah, we never get any credit for what we do, and no-one ever notices us until things go wrong&#8221;

In fact, it&#8217;s a common joke amongstÂ IT pros that you&#8217;re never noticed until something breaks.

You know why that is? You don&#8217;t communicate enough.

To me, IT &#8211; good IT &#8211;Â is just as much about communicating the value you&#8217;re adding as it is about actually doing cool stuff and making things run well.

We know the awesome stuff we do on a daily basis, and how great that major new upgrade to the email server is, but **unless you&#8217;re able to communicate with your user base**, and break it down into language that non-IT people can understand, **no one is ever going to value IT**. Because they don&#8217;t see what you do; and they don&#8217;t understand how the magical thing you&#8217;ve implemented makes their lives easier.``

Communicate the value and the benefits, and you&#8217;ll get a much more appreciative user base ðŸ™‚

PS. Apologies if you saw an earlier version of this laden with expletives and poor spelling/grammar. I wrote a messy draft on WordPress for Windows Phone and rather than save it to drafts when I hit Save, it seemed to have published it. Anyway, I&#8217;ve tidied it up now ðŸ™‚
