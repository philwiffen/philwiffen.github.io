You may, or may not, have noticed that the site was in various flavours of unavailable yesterday. Things included MySQL not responding, Site not responding, and Server 500 errors. It wasn&#8217;t anything I did so I assume it was my host upgrading stuff. Attempting to check the error logs yesterday was fruitless as Site5&#8217;s admin interface wouldn&#8217;t show me anything, so I&#8217;m still not totally sure of the cause.

Hopefully, by now, everything&#8217;s sorted, but I&#8217;ll be keeping my eyes open for more issues.
