Last week, via aÂ [tweet from Frank Denneman](https://twitter.com/FrankDenneman/status/327027475580338176), I discovered a whitepaperÂ that covers the differences between storage IOPS and storage throughput, as well as best practises for performance benchmarking.

As someone relatively new to the inner workings of storage, I found it very enlightening.Â Particularly the fact that there&#8217;s a clear difference between IOPS and throughput, and you need to decide what you want from a storage system before you benchmark it. Well worth a read, even if it&#8217;s the first 9 pages which covers the different types of workload (IOPS vs Storage).

The whitepaper from EMCÂ is here: <a href="https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-20661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elements Of Performance And Testing Best Practices Defined</a>  
Frank&#8217;s post, with a summary of the white paper is here: [Awesome read: Storage Performance And Testing Best Practices](http://frankdenneman.nl/2013/04/24/awesome-read-storage-performance-and-testing-best-practices/)
