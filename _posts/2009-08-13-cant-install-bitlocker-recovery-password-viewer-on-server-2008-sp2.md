If you can&#8217;t install the &#8220;BitLocker Recovery Password Viewer for Active Directory Users and Computers tool&#8221; on Server 2008, it&#8217;s probably because you&#8217;re running SP2. Sigh.

When you try to run the Windows6.0-KB928202-x64.msu or Windows6.0-KB928202-x86.msu file you&#8217;ll get the error message:

&#8220;The update does not apply to your system&#8221;

This is because it doesn&#8217;t seem to support Server 2008 with SP2.
