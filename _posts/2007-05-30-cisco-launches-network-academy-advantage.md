I haven&#8217;t seen Cisco officially announce it on the Network Academy Headlines, but the new [NetAcad Advantage](http://www.netacadadvantage.com/) website is up. It&#8217;s aimed at anyone who&#8217;s completed the Cisco Network Academy courses and is looking to further their career and take advantage of their new skills.

This should be great for all the Academy regions that currently don&#8217;t have a proper Career Connection portal (The UK included) . I&#8217;ve been waiting and pushing for something like this for over a year now; and it&#8217;s great that Cisco is taking care of its students.

I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how the site progresses and grows. Who knows, maybe they&#8217;ll ask the author of the excellent Career Builder&#8217;s Toolkit, [Matt Moran](http://www.cbtoolkit.com/), to contribute? ðŸ™‚
