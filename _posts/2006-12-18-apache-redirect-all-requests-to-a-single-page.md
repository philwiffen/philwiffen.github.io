We&#8217;re migrating servers at work, and I needed to show a single &#8220;We&#8217;re moving&#8221; page no matter what URL was requested. Here&#8217;s how to do it permanently, and temporarily:

> `RedirectMatch permanent .*       http://yoursite.com/migration.html`

> `RedirectMatch temp .*       http://yoursite.com/migration.html`

Make sure you point to a different domain than the one you&#8217;re migrating! ğŸ˜‰
