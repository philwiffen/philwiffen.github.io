I have a problem. And it&#8217;s stopping me from learning.

I&#8217;ve swallowed the line that it takes [10,000Â hoursÂ toÂ masterÂ aÂ skill](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26384712), and it&#8217;s scared me off learning new things.

I am naturally curious. I want to learn, but I put off doing so because I know I&#8217;ll never be an expert in that field. So instead I potter around the fringes and play with things half-heartedly.

That was, until I watched this TEDx video: [TheÂ firstÂ 20Â hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)Â  (20 minutes)

In it, Josh Kaufman discusses why you don&#8217;t need to burn 10,000 hours on a subject, why 20 hours of focused practice is &#8220;good enough&#8221;, and how to overcome the inertia that prevents you from learning new things in the first place.

It&#8217;s well worth a watch, especially if &#8211; like me &#8211; you&#8217;re putting off learning because you&#8217;re scared of the amount of effort it&#8217;ll take to be good: because 20 hours is good enough ðŸ™‚

# A quick summary of what I picked up

20 hours in perspective:

  * 20 hours is only **45 minutes per day, for a month**. That means you can pick up a new subject/skill in around a month of lunches! How&#8217;s that for motivation?

4 steps to rapid skill acquisition:

  1. Deconstruct the skill 
      1. Decide what you want to do when you&#8217;re done 
          1. Example: be proficient in setting up and managing VMware vSphere
      2. Then break down the skill into chunks/pieces, that will get you to that total goal 
          1. Example: VMware vSphere. Break it the learning down into individual components and focus on those. Install, Configure it, and troubleshoot. Also focus on day-to-day management tasks like setting up Datastores, troubleshooting performance issues, andÂ  setting up vMotion.
  2. Learn enough to self correct 
      1. Once you start learning, you can begin to self-correct yourself based on earlier learning.
  3. Remove practise barriers (distractions) 
      1. TV, Twitter, email client, mobile phone.
  4. Practice at least 20 hours. Don&#8217;t give up! 
      1. Break through the initial frustration barrier, where things feel like they don&#8217;t make much sense or that you&#8217;re not making much progress. Stick with it, long enough to learn it properly and you&#8217;ll be pleased with the results.
