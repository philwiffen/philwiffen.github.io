It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but I&#8217;ve finally got the [Twitter bug](http://twitter.com/mindcircus). It&#8217;s nice not having to worry about typing something of &#8220;value&#8221;, like I feel I need to in a blog post. 

Feel free to follow my [inane updates](http://twitter.com/mindcircus) if you like ðŸ˜›
