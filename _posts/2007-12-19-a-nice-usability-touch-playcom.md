If you get your password wrong 3 times in a row, [Play.com](http://www.play.com/) automatically takes you to the &#8220;send me my password&#8221; page. 

This is a great usability touch. It&#8217;s pretty likely that if you&#8217;ve entered your password wrong three times, you&#8217;ve forgotten it. Removing the hassle of looking around for the &#8220;Forgot your password?&#8221; link is a very nice, and welcome, judgement call.
