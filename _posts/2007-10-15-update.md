Just wanted to take 10 minutes or so to highlight what&#8217;s going on in my life at the moment, and perhaps explain why I&#8217;ve not been very active online lately.

### Work

I started my new job at [DisplayLink](http://www.displaylink.com/) on the 17th of September. I&#8217;m enjoying it a lot, but the hours and commute are longer than [Crownhill](http://www.crownhill.co.uk/) so I&#8217;m generally finding myself with less spare time than before. 

### Life

Naturally, most weekends are spent away from a computer, with Jade, either in Cambridge or London. I just added a bunch of [**photos from my latest visit to London**](http://flickr.com/photos/mindcircus/sets/72157602438238977/) on Flickr, where we popped into Camden, Covent Garden, [along the Thames](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mindcircus/1580106891/), towards the [Millenium Bridge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mindcircus/1581028618/), a brief stop at [St Paul&#8217;s](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mindcircus/1581023410/), and then onto the [Tate Modern](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mindcircus/1580173355/). It was a very pleasant day ðŸ™‚

I&#8217;ve also been looking for a flat in Cambridge to reduce my commute.

### Blog

The blog has been neglected badly. I have a lot of things I want to do and post about, and also a lot of draft posts that I need to finish, including: 

  * Investigating the new aircrack-ng 1.0 beta with (alleged) AirPcap Tx support built in
  * Testing the new AirPcap Tx beta from CACE (Probably best left to Crownhill for the moment)
  * Automating software deployments using AutoIT
  * Setting up a WSUS Server
  * Basic Linux commands

This will all come in time.
