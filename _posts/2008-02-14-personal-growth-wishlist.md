A few things I&#8217;d really like to do at some point&#8230;

  1. Learn how to [speak publicly](http://www.speakoutchallenge.com/).
  2. Become a career mentor, or an IT mentor, or both. (I&#8217;m probably too young for this just yet).
  3. Actually get around to reading Getting Things Done (oh the irony).

Maybe I&#8217;ll turn this into a WordPress page (rather than a Blog Post) and add to it as more things pop into my head ðŸ™‚
