So far today I&#8217;ve upgraded 3 BlackBerries from v4.2 software to v4.5. One of the more usefulfeatures in 4.5 is the ability to view Free/Busy times on the handheld. It&#8217;s because of this feature that I&#8217;m rolling it out to key BB users. At the moment I&#8217;m doing it manually via USB/Desktop Manager, butÂ I&#8217;ll investigate OTA/Automated updates later on ðŸ™‚

You can get the latest OS for your BB from the [crackberry forums](http://forums.crackberry.com/f1/). Just click on your BlackBerry model range and within that forum, stickied at the top will be downloads for the various models. The forums include upgrade instructions &#8211; very handy for newbs like me! ðŸ™‚ As an example, here&#8217;s a link for theÂ [latest BB OS for the Curve 8310](http://forums.crackberry.com/f52/newest-8310-os-v4-5-0-55-multilanguage-55061/).

As an aside, when testing the procedure, I set myself up on a BB. Bad move, and now I know why people call them CrackBerries &#8211; they&#8217;ve insanely addictive! I promptly deleted myself once testing was over to preserve my sanity ðŸ™‚
