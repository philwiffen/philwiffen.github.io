I haven&#8217;t posted, or replied to any blog-related emails, for a few weeks now. There&#8217;s a few reasons for that, but the main one has been that, after months of interviews, my job search intensified and I had to drop something to retain my sanity.

Crazy amounts of interviews, and six job offers later, I finally have things pretty much sorted now; and I hope to get back to posting, and replying to all my emails, some time this week.

I&#8217;ll be sure to write down some of my thoughts on job searching and the whole &#8220;recruitment&#8221; game in the future &#8211; I&#8217;ve certainly learned a lot!
