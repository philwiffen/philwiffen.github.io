**Update on 2016-05-18:** An update on the saga is here: [An update on the poor customer service from Microsoft Band support](http://kabri.uk/2016/05/18/an-update-on-the-poor-customer-service-from-microsoft-band-support/)

* * *

**Update on 2015-12-11**. I used resolver.co.uk and Microsoft didn&#8217;t respond in 14 days, so I&#8217;ve escalated the case. Apparently this goes to Satya Nadella, but I&#8217;m not convinced he really has time to deal with customer service complaints ðŸ™‚ Hopefully I&#8217;ll hear some positive news soon.

* * *

**Original from November 2015:** You may have seen me recently tweet about my ongoing Microsoft Band issue. Basically, it started falling apart after less than 7 months worth of use. I paid Â£169.99 for the Band back in April, and I feel a 24/7 fitness device should last significantly longer than that before it starts falling apart. In the UK we have some laws that govern this stuff, and I&#8217;m frankly appalled that I&#8217;ve had to start quoting those laws and (attempting to) exercise them. Most companies I&#8217;ve dealt with in the past are fantastic when devices exhibit faults early in their life and replace items with no quibbles. Not Microsoft, it seems.

[I&#8217;m not the only one seeing these issues](http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/44c2e1e3-4548-47d2-8e79-2ff9db78ed01). It seems like a design flaw in the battery placement on the original Band, and one which the Band 2 works around by moving the battery location.

I&#8217;ve summarised the saga below (and even that is verging on TL;DR :)).

  * As early as 3.5 months into ownership, the Band started to show signs of early wear: the plastic skin that covers the batteries started to bulge and peel. I reported this, and was told nothing could be done as it&#8217;s purely cosmetic.

  * Between 6 and 7 months, the batteries started to come away from the Band strap itself. And the plastic had peeled almost completely off the Band&#8217;s batteries, causing some mild skin irritation.

              * I contacted Microsoft again. They agreed to replace the Band. I shipped it off.
              * The band was then returned 14 days later, in its original state (not repaired). Included in the package was a template letter, effectively saying that I&#8217;d caused the damage and that therefore my warranty was voided and no repair would take place.  
                > By the way: one of the conditions that voids your warranty is &#8220;Scratches and Dents&#8221;. Yes. On a fitness band. That&#8217;s meant to be worn 24/7. Especially during activity where it might get knocked (running, football, weight training).
            
              * After arguing that I&#8217;d never purposefully damaged the device, Microsoft agreed to escalate the case and arrange a replacement. After 3 days of hearing nothing, I chased (I&#8217;ve spent over 8 hours of my life chasing this thing. Microsoft rarely let me know the outcome of the escalations).
              * In a series of events following I was then informed that I hadn&#8217;t packaged the device sufficiently when I originally sent it (in spite of being told that a padded jiffy bag would be fine) and so they wouldn&#8217;t replace the device.
              * I then had to resort to using under the Sale of Goods Act, complaining that the device wasn&#8217;t fit for purpose. My desired resolution was to be shipped a Band 2, as that wouldn&#8217;t exhibit the same design flaws that the original Band does. Shipping me an identical device with the same design flaws will only lead to the possibility of another return.
              * This this complaint/suggestion, was rejected by Escalations. Dead end.</ul> 
            
            So here I am. 24 calendar days since I first shipped the device back to Microsoft. Still with a faulty product. Still miffed at Microsoft. I&#8217;ve now complained about this via resolver.co.uk, but I don&#8217;t hold out much hope. What next, legal action? I hope it doesn&#8217;t have to come to that. It certainly should never have gotten this far.
