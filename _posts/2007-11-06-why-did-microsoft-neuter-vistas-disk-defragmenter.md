Here&#8217;s an [FAQ explaining the design decisions](http://blogs.technet.com/filecab/articles/440717.aspx) surrounding Vista&#8217;s new <strike>shitty</strike> shiny Disk Defragmenter.

OK, so the new I/O and CPU usage stuff is awesome (my favourite feature in Diskeeper), but to completely remove any graphical representation and then remove any progress indication is incredibly short sighted. 

Sure, it makes sense to simplify the standard interface and protect general users from the &#8220;scary&#8221; internals of their OS, but, as the comments say, at least give Power users, or those that might be curious to learn more, the option to see what the hell is happening inside their system!

The more I am exposed to Vista, the harder I grip onto my copy of XP Pro.
