If you have a Technet subscription, you can get early access to Windows XP Service Pack 3 from the [Technet Subscriptions page.](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/subscriptions/default.aspx) Scroll down the page and look for the grey &#8220;Top Downloads&#8221; section.

I&#8217;ve been running it for a few days now and haven&#8217;t had any problems ðŸ™‚

If you don&#8217;t have a Microsoft Technet subscription &#8211; which I highly recommend &#8211; you can probably find a direct download link around [somewhere](http://www.asktheadmin.com/2008/04/get-real-xp-sp3-download-before-rush.html).
