You&#8217;d think so, judging from this [Hotfix Request page](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus2/emailcontact.aspx?scid=sw;[LN];1414&from=KBHotfix&WS=hotfix).

Notice the wording in this section:

The word you&#8217;re looking for is: _than_, not then. 

Come on guys, the [difference between then and than](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/than.html) is far more than a single letter.
