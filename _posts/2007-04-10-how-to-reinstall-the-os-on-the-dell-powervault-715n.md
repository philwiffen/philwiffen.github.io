We have a small family of PowerVault 715N&#8217;s here at Crownhill. They&#8217;re lovely boxes, but reinstalling the OS on them is something of a black art

Admittedly it&#8217;s a long time since I ran a reinstall, but from memory, it **must** be done with a Windows 2000 client: XP just plain refused to work.

[Dell&#8217;s article](http://support.euro.dell.com/support/topics/topic.aspx/emea/shared/support/dsn/en/document?c=uk&l=en&s=gen&dn=1065245) should cover everything you need to know.
