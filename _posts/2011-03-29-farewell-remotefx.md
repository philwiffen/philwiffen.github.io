I&#8217;ve spent the last few months playing with RemoteFX, including a fair amount of educated guesswork and hardware hacking to get a functioning system as &#8211; at the time &#8211; Microsoft&#8217;s documentation was a bit sporadic, and supported systems were just way too expensive for an exploration project. Mind you, even now they&#8217;re pricey; but RemoteFX isn&#8217;t aimed at the mainstream just yet.

It&#8217;s being retired now, so I figured I&#8217;d take a farewell photo of the AMD FirePro V5800 I managed to squeeze into a Dell R710 server.

Good luck RemoteFX &#8211; with some performance tweaks and a version 2.0, you&#8217;ll be awesome for VDI ðŸ™‚
