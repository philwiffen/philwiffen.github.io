You can grab the Adobe Reader 9.1 MSI installer from here:

<ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/9.x/9.1/enu/>

Other languages besides English are available by going up a directory ðŸ™‚

Now I just need to do something with the MSP files you can get from the other directories!

**UPDATE:** I&#8217;ve documented [what to do with the MSP files](http://www.kabri.uk/2009/08/26/how-to-apply-msp-patch-files-to-adobe-9-1-msi-installer/)
