I&#8217;m currently playing with [Connection Manager Administration Kit for Server 2008](http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Windows-Server-2008-Connection-Manager-Administration-Kit.html). 

Why? Because with the advent of Windows 7 (and Vista, to a certain extent), it&#8217;s a complete pain in the butt to programme a tool like AutoIT to script and automate the configuration of a VPN connection for our end users. The key issue, is that Microsoft don&#8217;t seem to provide any &#8220;command line&#8221; shortcuts through things like DLLs or Shell extensions to quickly bring up the &#8220;Set up a new connection or network&#8221; wizard. Sad face.
