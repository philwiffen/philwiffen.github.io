Thanks to a high profile campaign by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver, the British public are [buying less intensively-farmed chicken](http://www.politics.co.uk/press-releases/rspca-shoppers-give-cheap-chicken-bird-$1208968.htm):

> A new RSPCA poll shows the recent campaign on the plight of meat chickens reared in the UK each year Ã¢â‚¬â€œ highlighted in programmes presented by Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall &#8211; has changed people&#8217;s buying habits.
> 
> The poll shows an amazing 73 per cent of consumers said that since recently discovering standard chickens were farmed in poor conditions they now buy chickens that have had a better life. 

My vegan sister may have helped me over to [the dark side](http://www.vegsoc.org/)( ðŸ˜‰ ), but I&#8217;m still very pleased that the public is becoming more aware of where their meat comes from and how it lived. Much kudos to the RSPCA, Hugh, and Jamie!
