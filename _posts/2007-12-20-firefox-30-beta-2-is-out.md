![Mozilla Firefox 3.0 Beta 2 is out](http://www.kabri.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/firefox-wordmark-horizontal3.png)

Seems I&#8217;m running a little late on this one&#8230;

Beta 2 of Firefox 3.0 was released a few days ago (18th of December 2007). I&#8217;ve yet to test it&#8230;you know how manic things get right before the seasonal holidays!

Things improved in Beta 2:
