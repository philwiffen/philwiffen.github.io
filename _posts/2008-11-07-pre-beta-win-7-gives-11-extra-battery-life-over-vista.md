According to Engadget, even in a Pre-Beta state, Win 7 is [making great progress](http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/06/video-windows-7-promises-faster-boots-and-up-to-15-better-batt/)

> Windows 7 also manages wireless radios better allowing them to drop below 100% power draw while managing the connection. And by tweaking the OS kernel, the CPU can sometimes run at a lower frequency and stay idle longer. This results are aÂ _minimum_Â of 11% better battery life for Windows 7 compared to Vista &#8212; and we&#8217;re still only talking aboutÂ <span>pre-Beta</span>Â Windows 7 software, mind you. Nice.Â 

Nice, indeed ðŸ™‚
