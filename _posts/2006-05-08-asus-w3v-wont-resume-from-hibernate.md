Problem: After installing Hardware drivers from Windows Update I found my W3V would not boot up from a hibernated state. The progress bar appears to finish, but windows never loads the GUI.

Solution: Turns out, the LAN drivers Windows Update installs mess with the power management features on the W3V, preventing it from successfully booting from a hibernated state. You should re-install the Asus LAN Drivers from here: <http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us>
